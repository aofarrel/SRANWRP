TB accessions from special places.

* auspice_unique: TB accessions which are available on Nextstrain, but are not in tb_a3 nor the known lineage dataset. SAMEA3721543 gets dropped for only having one fastq, and SAMEA3491431 times out during decontamination at default settings. SAMEA1707222 goes through fastq-TBprofiler as La3 and Sensitive, while SAMEA806953 returns no lineage and HR-TB.
* ref_set: TB accessions from [Borrell et al.](doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0214088) Some of these are already present in other datasets.

# inputs

**Not every sample in here has been vetted.** BioSample accessions that cause issues in myco_sra (example: SAMN07344554) will be removed from tb_a3_rand*.txt files as needed, and placed on the appropriate denylist. Do not consider tb_a3.txt or tb_a3_no_lineage.txt to have been filtered via the denylists.

## denylists
Lists of accessions that should not be used in production pipelines.

## legacy
Input files used during development of older versions of the pipeline. You should probably ignore this folder.

## quick_tests
Input files for quick tests, ie, relatively small lists of accessions.

## tb_accessions
Lists of various tuberculosis accessions. See [./tb_accessions/readme.md](./tb_accessions/readme.md) for more information.

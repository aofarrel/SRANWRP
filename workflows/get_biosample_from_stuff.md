# get BioSample from run

This workflow is now deprecated. Please search Dockstore for the newer version (which will have BioSample in its title), which has more features and is more reliable.

This deprecated version relies on elink, which is known to be unreliable. While it is technically correct and may work for you, it may also simply give you blank output or timeout depending on the status of NCBI's servers' at any given time.
